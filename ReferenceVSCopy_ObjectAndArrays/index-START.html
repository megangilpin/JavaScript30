    // Primitive data types are tightly coupled with the variable they are assigned to and can be copied and changed with out effecting the variable it was copied from
    
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Arrays and Objects behave differently. Values are actually stored just once when instantiated, and assigning a variable just creates a pointer (reference) to that value.
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // When you thinking you are making a copy, you are actually assigning a REFERENCE  or SHALLOW COPY to the original array. 
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // So when you do the below::
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // You are actually changing both players and team because team refers back to players. 
    console.log("Results in updating both array:")
    console.log(players, team)

    //Same happens with objects:
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log("Results in updating both objects:")
    console.log(person, captain)
    // Ways to make a deep copy of Arrays:
    //1. .slice()
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 2;
    console.log(".slice()")
    console.log(players, team2)
    
    //2. .concat()
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 3;
    console.log(".concat()")
    console.log(players, team3)

    //3. ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 4;
    console.log("ES6 Spread");
    console.log(players, team4);

    //4. Array.from()
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 5;
    console.log("Array.from()");
    console.log(players, team5);

    /// Ways to make a deep copy of Objects:

    //1. Object.assign
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person);
    cap2.age = 52
    console.log("Object.assign")
    console.log(person, cap2);

    //2.Spread operator
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.age = 105
    console.log("Spread Operator")
    console.log(person, cap3);

    // !!!!Important to know!!!!! this is only one level deep. Meaning if there is an object contained in an object you copied it is a shallow copy. If try to update this object it will update the original object

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.social.twitter = "hi";
    dev.age = 0;
    console.log(wes, dev);

    //how to make a deep copy of second level object
    // const frontend = {...wes, social: {...wes.social}}
    // or
    const engineer = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))
    engineer.social.twitter = "yo!";
    engineer.age = 11;
    console.log(wes, engineer);
